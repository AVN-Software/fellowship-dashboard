Good differentiated learning activities for the groupwork component of the lesson. Teacher asks questions to determine whether learners understand the activity. Also incorporates brain breaks in the form of a breathing exercise.",
      "improvements": "Teacher could state learning objectives at the start of the lesson to orientate learners around the outcome of every single lesson right at the beginning. Teacher could ask individual learners for feedback on the mat; instead of having them shout out answers. This will help her to gauge individual learner understanding in real-time; in a group setting. Teacher could also utilise group work more effectively by assigning leadership roles within the group, in order to enhance learning in the small group setting.",

Future world of work skills brought into lesson. Teacher attempts to enforce classroom rules by reminding learners to raise their hands when answering questions. Teacher also creates a positive learning environment by employing a lighthearted example of using language that learners understand. Uses very practical example by relating to her own business. Asks learners probing questions to help learners think: elevator pitch. Explicit modelling of structure and tone of letter. Including locally relevant example of a tyre shop in Bonteheuwel.",
      "improvements": "Check learners' understanding of the activity by asking individual learner's the individual steps of the activity. Pause and wait for learners to answer questions, e.g. what is an elevator pitch. Answers provided too quickly. Consider asking a learner to provide an example of a business they'd like to start and develop the sponsorship letter writing process from there. Collaboration could be more explicit, e.g. have the group work on one letter, with each learner responsible for a different section.the Future World of Work theme could be even more explicit, e.g. a FWOW business in Bonteheuwel. Could even suggest a business for each group to work on. Next steps were not clear.",

Rules were reinforced throughout the lesson - learners were encouraged to raise their hands. Teacher encouraged paired work by saying: 'talk to your neighbour', in order to answer the question. Teacher has good relationships with learners; they listen well and there is mutual respect. Teacher will also explain concepts in isiXhosa, if learners do not understand in English.",
      "improvements": "Leadership roles not evident in lesson. Classroom rules not displayed in class. Makes it easier to enforce the rule if it is visible in the learning environment. Teacher could ask more specific, intentional questions aimed at individual learners, not vague questions aimed at the group. Also, teacher can ask more higher order questions to encourage more abstract thinking. Lesson was not contextualised to the Sustainability theme.",

Strong instructional techniques Clear step-by-step structuring and remediation through learner edits on the board showed effective scaffolding. High learner engagement Multiple strategies used \u2014 including calling learners by name, encouraging participation, and adapting activities to group dynamics \u2014 resulted in visibly high engagement.

Add sentence starters, examples, or visual cues to support understanding. Clarify Task Structures Decide in advance whether an activity is individual, pair, or group work \u2014 and communicate this clearly to learners.

Connect edits to success criteria (e.g., \"We used the past tense correctly here \u2014 that\u2019s great thinking!\").

      "strengths_observed": " Classroom routines and transitions Rayhaana uses a clear and engaging classroom management activity (hands on head, ears and clap) to focus learners and transition smoothly. She also reminds learners to listen before reading and not to speak all at once\u2014these routines support order and attention. Connection to prior knowledge She effectively references previous content (steam trains, Gautrain, electric & diesel), anchoring new learning in familiar contexts. Learner engagement and interaction Learners are attentive and actively engaged with the content. Rayhaana asks questions throughout the reading (e.g., about vaccines, flu), which keeps students involved and checks for understanding in real time. Comprehension and collaborative learning She concludes with comprehension review questions and encourages learners to help each other\u2014both promoting deeper understanding and peer support. Thematic and inclusive framing Rayhaana introduces a leadership theme (\u201cgirl leadership\u201d and careers for women), bringing real-world relevance and inclusive representation into the lesson.",
      "improvements": "Scaffolding for learners who struggle Teacher could ask ore comprehensive questions after the reading activity. Clarity on student work structures It\u2019s unclear whether she planned groupwork or individual work (\u201cGroupwork? Or individual work?\u201d)\u2014this suggests the structure of activities might need clearer planning or communication. Visual aids and expectations management There's a question about whether rules were \u201cpre-prepared\u201d on flipchart or displayed on the board, indicating possible inconsistencies in visual management or clarity of expectations. Consistent follow-up on preparatory work While there is mention of follow-up on pre work and homework, it\u2019s not clear how systematically this was done\u2014there may be an opportunity to strengthen routines around checking and building on these assignments. ",
      "next_steps": "Plan scaffolding strategies for varied learner responses Rayhaana to prepare layered support (e.g. sentence starters, vocabulary prompts, think-pair-share) to use when learners struggle to answer independently. Clarify instructional modes and structures in planning Specify when learners are to work individually, in pairs, or groups\u2014aligned with learning objectives\u2014and communicate this clearly at the start of each activity. Enhance visual presentation of classroom rules and expectations Prepare and display visual aids (instructions, rules, expectations) in accessible places (boards or flipcharts), ensuring clarity and reference throughout the lesson. Deepen inclusivity by integrating leadership themes intentionally Rayhaana to build on the \u201cgirl leadership\u201d theme by including more opportunities for all learners to share their thoughts on leadership, perhaps via reflection prompts or projects, as part of the lesson. Embed reflection and feedback routines Use a post lesson reflective cycle, as an ongoing reflective practice for professional growth",
